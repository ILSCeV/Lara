## Club management software built on top of Laravel 5.0

## About
**Lara** ("**Ve**rwaltung **d**es **St**udentenclubs") is a planning tool that combines a calender with personnel scheduling, developed for [bc-Studentenclub](http://www.bc-club.de) and intended to scale to all Ilmenauer Studentenclub e.V. sections.
It started as a softwareproject at [TU Ilmenau](http://tu-ilmenau.de) in WS2014/2015 and is currently being developed further as a personal project, with plans of adding finance management, and internal statistics and data analysis in future versions.
